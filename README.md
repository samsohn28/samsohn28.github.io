# My website

I've been meaning to get around to creating my own site since, well, ever. Lo and behold, here it is!

## Purpose

There are a lot of peopl that have personal websites just to have one, but I hope to use it purposefully as a tool to market myself and express my thoughts.

## Made with

* [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Site host
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) - Static site generator
